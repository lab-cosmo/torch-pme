Advanced neighbor list usage
============================

.. currentmodule:: torchpme

Accurately calculating forces as derivatives from energy is crucial for predicting
system dynamics as well as in training machine learning models. In systems where forces
are derived from the gradients of the potential energy, it is essential that the
distance calculations between particles are included in the computational graph. This
ensures that the force computations respect the dependencies between particle positions
and distances, allowing for accurate gradients during backpropagation.

.. figure:: ../../static/images/backprop-path.*

    Visualization of the data flow to compute the energy from the ``cell``,
    ``positions`` and ``charges`` through a neighborlist calculator and the potential
    calculator. All operations on the red line have to be tracked to obtain the correct
    computation of derivatives on the ``positions``.

In this tutorial, we demonstrate two methods for maintaining differentiability when
computing distances between particles. The **first method** manually recomputes
``distances`` within the computational graph using ``positions``, ``cell`` information,
and neighbor shifts, making it suitable for any neighbor list code.

The **second method** uses a backpropagable neighbor list from the `vesin-torch
<https://luthaf.fr/vesin>`_ library, which automatically ensures that the distance
calculations remain differentiable.

.. note::

    While both approaches yield the same result, a backpropagable neighbor list is
    generally preferred because it eliminates the need to manually recompute distances.
    This not only simplifies your code but also improves performance.

Tune paramaters
---------------

Based on our system we will first *tune* the PME parameters for an accurate
computation. We first convert the ``positions``, ``charges`` and the ``cell`` from
NumPy arrays into torch tensors and compute the summed squared charges.

Generic Neighborlist
--------------------

One usual workflow is to compute the distance vectors using default tools like the
the default (NumPy) version of the vesin neighbor list.

track these operations.

Backpropagable Neighborlist
---------------------------

We now repeat the computation of the forces, but instead of using a generic neighbor
list and our custom ``distances`` function, we directly use a neighbor list function
that tracks the operations, as implemented by the ``vesin-torch`` library.

We first ``detach`` and ``clone`` the position tensor to create a new computational
graph

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 235-239

.. code-block:: Python


    positions_new = positions.detach().clone()
    positions_new.requires_grad = True
