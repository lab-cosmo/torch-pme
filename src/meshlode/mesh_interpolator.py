class MeshInterpolator:
    """
    Class for handling all steps related to interpolations in the context of a mesh
    based Ewald summation.

    In particular, this includes two core functionalities: 1. "forwards"
    interpolation, in which the "charges" or more general "particle weights" of
    atoms are assigned to grid points of a mesh. This is done in the
    "points_to_mesh" function. 2. "backwards" interpolation, in which values defined
    on a mesh are interpolated to arbitrary positions typically lying between mesh
    points. This is done in the "mesh_to_points" function.

    Since the computation of the interpolation weights for both of the above types
    of calculations is identical, this is performed in a separate function called
    "compute_interpolation_weights".

    :param interpolation_order: int
        The degree of the polynomials used for interpolation. A higher order leads
        to smoother interpolation, at a computational cost that grows cubically with
        the interpolation order (once one moves to the 3D case).
