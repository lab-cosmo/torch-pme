    r"""Potential computed using the Ewald sum.

    Scaling as :math:`\mathcal{O}(N^2)` with respect to the number of particles
    :math:`N`.

    For computing a **neighborlist** a reasonable ``cutoff`` is half the length of
    the shortest cell vector, which can be for example computed according as

    .. code-block:: python

        cell_dimensions = torch.linalg.norm(cell, dim=1)
        cutoff = torch.min(cell_dimensions) / 2 - 1e-6

    This ensures a accuracy of the short range part of ``1e-5``.

    :param exponent: the exponent :math:`p` in :math:`1/r^p` potentials
    :param atomic_smearing: Width of the atom-centered Gaussian used to split the
        Coulomb potential into the short- and long-range parts. A reasonable value for
        most systems is to set it to ``1/5`` times the neighbor list cutoff. If
        :py:obj:`None` ,it will be set to 1/5 times of half the largest box vector
        (separately for each structure).
    :param lr_wavelength: Spatial resolution used for the long-range (reciprocal space)
        part of the Ewald sum. More conretely, all Fourier space vectors with a
        wavelength >= this value will be kept. If not set to a global value, it will be
        set to half the atomic_smearing parameter to ensure convergence of the
        long-range part to a relative precision of 1e-5.
    :param subtract_interior: If set to :py:obj:`True`, subtract from the features of an
        atom the contributions to the potential arising from all atoms within the cutoff
        Note that if set to true, the self contribution (see previous) is also
        subtracted by default.

    For an **example** on the usage refer to :py:class:`PMEPotential`.
