    r"""Potential using a direct summation.

    Scaling as :math:`\mathcal{O}(N^2)` with respect to the number of particles
    :math:`N`. As opposed to the Ewald sum, this calculator does NOT take into account
    periodic images, and it will instead be assumed that the provided atoms are in the
    infinitely extended three-dimensional Euclidean space. While slow, this
    implementation used as a reference to test faster algorithms.

    :param exponent: the exponent :math:`p` in :math:`1/r^p` potentials

    Example
    -------
    We compute the energy of two charges which are sepearated by 2 along the z-axis.

    >>> import torch
    >>> from vesin.torch import NeighborList

    Define simple example structure

    >>> positions = torch.tensor(
    ...     [[0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 2.0]], dtype=torch.float64
    ... )
    >>> charges = torch.tensor([[1.0], [-1.0]], dtype=torch.float64)

    Compute the neighbor indices (``"i"``, ``"j"``) and the neighbor distances ("``d``")
    using the ``vesin`` package. Refer to the `documentation <https://luthaf.fr/vesin>`_
    for details on the API. We define a dummy cell

    >>> cell = torch.zeros(3, 3, dtype=torch.float64)
    >>> nl = NeighborList(cutoff=3.0, full_list=False)
    >>> i, j, neighbor_distances = nl.compute(
    ...     points=positions, box=cell, periodic=False, quantities="ijd"
    ... )
    >>> neighbor_indices = torch.stack([i, j], dim=1)

    Finally, we initlize the potential class and ``compute`` the potential for the
    system.

    >>> direct = DirectPotential()
    >>> direct.compute(
    ...     positions=positions,
    ...     charges=charges,
    ...     neighbor_indices=neighbor_indices,
    ...     neighbor_distances=neighbor_distances,
    ... )
    tensor([[-0.2500],
            [ 0.2500]], dtype=torch.float64)

    Which is the expected potential since :math:`V \propto 1/r` where :math:`r` is the
    distance between the particles.
