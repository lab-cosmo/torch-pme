    Base class defining the interface for a reciprocal-space kernel helper.

    Provides an interface to compute the reciprocal-space convolution kernel
    that is used e.g. to compute potentials using Fourier transforms. Parameters
    of the kernel in derived classes should be defined and stored in the
    ``__init__`` method.

    NB: we need this slightly convoluted way of implementing what often amounts
    to a simple, pure function of :math:`|\mathbf{k}|^2` in order to be able to
    provide a customizable filter class that can be jitted.

class KSpaceFilter(torch.nn.Module):
    r"""
    Apply a reciprocal-space filter to a real-space mesh.

    The class combines the costruction of a reciprocal-space grid
    :math:`\{mathbf{k}_n\}`
    (that should be commensurate to the grid in real space, so the class takes
    the same options as :class:`MeshInterpolator`), the calculation of
    a scalar filter function :math:`\phi(|\mathbf{k}|^2)`, defined as a function of
    the squared norm of the reciprocal space grid points, and the application
    of the filter to a real-space function :math:`f(\mathbf{x})`,
    defined on a mesh :math:`\{mathbf{x}_n\}`.

    In practice, the application of the filter amounts to
    :math:`f\rightarrow \hat{f} \rightarrow \hat{\tilde{f}}=
    \hat{f} \phi \rightarrow \tilde{f}`

    See also the :ref:`example-kspace-demo` for a demonstration of the functionalities
    of this class.
