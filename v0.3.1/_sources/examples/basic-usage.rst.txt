Basic Usage
===========

.. currentmodule:: torchpme

This example showcases how the main capabilities of ``torchpme``.
We build a simple ionic crystal and compute the electrostatic potential and the forces
for each atom.

To follow this tutorial, it is assumed that torch-pme has been :ref:`installed
<userdoc-installation>` on your computer.

We initially set the ``device`` and ``dtype`` for the calculations. We will use the
CPU for this and double precision. If you have a CUDA devide you can also set the
device to ``"cuda"`` to use the GPU and speed up the calculations. Double precision is
a requirement for the neighbor list implementation that we are using here.

Generate Simple Example Structures
----------------------------------

Throughout this tutorial, we will work with a simple atomic structure in three
dimensions, which is a distorted version of the CsCl structure. The goal will be to
compute the electrostatic potentials and the forces for each atom.

We first generate a single unit cell of CsCl (2 atoms in the cell) where the Cs atoms
get a charge of +1 and the Cl atom a charge of -1.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 54-60

.. code-block:: Python


    atoms_unitcell = Atoms(
        "CsCl", cell=torch.eye(3), positions=[[0, 0, 0], [0.5, 0.5, 0.5]]
    )
    atoms_unitcell.set_initial_charges([1, -1])








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 61-63

We next generate a bigger structure by periodically repeating the unit cell 3 times in
each direction and apply a small random distortion to all atoms.

    atoms = atoms_unitcell.repeat(3)

        frames=[atoms],

We now extract the required properties from the :class:`ase.Atoms` object and store
them as individial variables as :class:`torch.Tensor`, which is the required input
type for *torch-pme*.

For the positions, we explicitly set `requires_grad=True`. This is because we are
ultimately interested in computing the forces, which are the gradients of the total
(electrostatic) energy with respect to the positions (up to a minus sign).
*torch-pme* can automatically compute such gradients, for which we need to communicate
at this point that we will need to take gradients with respect to the positions in
the future.

        atoms.get_initial_charges(), dtype=dtype, device=device
    ).unsqueeze(1)

Tuning: Find Optimal Hyperparameters
------------------------------------

Ewald and mesh methods require the specification of multiple hyperparameters, namely

1. the cutoff radius :math:`r_\mathrm{cut}`` for the short-range parts
2. the ``smearing`` parameter $\sigma$ determining the relative importance of the
   short-range and long-range terms in the split
3. either the mesh spacing :math:`h` for mesh-based methods, or a reciprocal space
   cutoff :math:`k_\mathrm{cut} = 2\pi/\lambda`` for the Ewald sum, where
   :math:`\lambda` is the shortest wavelength used in the Fourier series and
   corresponds to :math:`h` for mesh-based approaches

For ML applications, we typically first select a short-range cutoff to be the same to
conventional short-ranged ML models, and define the remaining parameters from there.
In this example, we are simply computing the Coulomb potential, and thus compute the
hyperparameters simply based on convergence criteria.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 115-122

.. code-block:: Python


    box_length = cell[0, 0]
    rcut = float(box_length) / 2 - 1e-10
    smearing = rcut / 5
    # lambda which gives the reciprocal space cutoff kcut=2*pi/lambda
    lr_wavelength = smearing / 2








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 123-147

However, especially for users without much experience on how to choose these
hyperparameters, we have built-in tuning functions for each Calculator (see below)
such as :func:`torchpme.tuning.tune_ewald`, which can automatically find a good set
of parameters. These can be used like this:

.. code-block:: python

  sum_charges_sq = torch.sum(charges**2, dim=0)
  smearing, lr_wavelength, rcut = tune_ewald(sum_charges_sq, cell, positions, accuracy=1e-1)

Define Potential
----------------

We now need to define the potential function with which the atoms interact. Since this
is a library for long-range ML, we support three major options:

1. the :class:`Coulomb potential <CoulombPotential>` (:math:`1/r`)
2. more general :class:`inverse power-law potentials <InversePowerLawPotential>` (:math:`1/r^p`)
3. an option to build custom potentials using :class:`splines <SplinePotential>`

This tutorial focuses on option (1), which is the most relevant from a practical point
of view. We can simply initialize an instance of the :class:`CoulombPotential` class that
contains all the necessary functions (such as those defining the short-range and
long-range splits) for this potential and makes them useable in the rest of the code.

Neighbor List
-------------

*torch-pme* requires us to compute the neighbor list (NL) in advance. This is because
for many ML applications, we would otherwise need to repeat this computation multiple
times during model training of a neural network etc. By computing it externally and
providing it as an input, we can streamline training workflows.
We compute the neighbor list using the ``vesin`` package, which also provides a
pytorch implementation that retains the computational graph. This will later allow us
to automatically compute gradients of the distances with respect to the atomic
coordinates. More details can be found in its documentation.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 165-171

    nl = NeighborList(cutoff=rcut, full_list=False)
    neighbor_indices, neighbor_distances = nl.compute(
        points=positions, box=cell, periodic=True, quantities="Pd"
    )

Main Part: Calculator
---------------------

The ``Calculator`` classes are the main user-facing classes in *torch-pme*. These are
used to compute atomic potentials :math:`V_i`` for a given set of positions and
particle weights (charges). For periodic calculators that are the main focus of this
tutorial, it is also required to specify a ``cell``. We have three periodic
calculators:

1. :class:`EwaldCalculator`: uses the Ewald sum. Recommended for structures with
   :math:`<10000` atoms due to its high accuracy and simplicity. Should be avoided for
   big structures due to the slower :math:`\mathcal{O}(N^2)` to
   :math:`\mathcal{O}(N^{\frac{3}{2}})` scaling of the computational cost (depending
   on how the hyperparameters are chosen) with respect to the number of atoms.
2. :class:`PMECalculator`: uses the Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) method. Mostly for
   reference.
3. :class:`P3MCalculator`: uses the Particle-Particle Particle-Mesh (P3M) method.
   Recommended for structures :math:`\ge 10000` atoms due to the efficient
   :math:`\mathcal{O}(N\log N)` scaling of the computational cost with the number of
   atoms.

Since our structure is relatively small, we use the :class:`EwaldCalculator`.
We start by the initialization of the class.

 .. code-block:: none

      (potential): CoulombPotential()
    )

Compute Energy
--------------

We have now all ingredients: we can use the ``Calculator`` class to, well, actually
compute the potentials :math:`V_i` at the position of the atoms, or the total energy
for the given particle weights (``charges``). The electrostatic potential can then be
obtained as

.. math::

  E = \sum_{i=1}^N q_i V_i

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 212-220

.. code-block:: Python


    potentials = calculator.forward(
        charges, cell, positions, neighbor_indices, neighbor_distances
    )
    energy = torch.sum(charges * potentials)

    print("Energy = \n", energy.item())





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    Energy = 
     -54.96703299644075




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 221-238

.. hint::

  The energy is in Gaussian units. You can change the unit system by setting the
  ``prefactor`` when initializing the calculator. For more details about this refer to
  :ref:`prefactors`.

Compute Forces using backpropagation (automatic differentiation)
----------------------------------------------------------------

The forces on the particles can simply be obtained as minus the gradient of the energy
with respect to the positions. These are easy to evaluate using the automatic
differentiation capabilities of `pytorch
<https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/autogradqs_tutorial.html>`_ using the
backpropagation method.

Note that this only works since we set ``requires_grad=True`` when we initialized the
positions tensor above.

.. code-block:: Python


    energy.backward()
    forces = -positions.grad

Aperiodic Structures
--------------------

For now, we have been using the :class:`EwaldCalculator` which is a periodic
calculator. We can however also use it for aperiodic structures by just using it as a
calculator with a cutoff radius. To start clone the positions to avoid accumulating
gradients with respect to the same variables multiple times
