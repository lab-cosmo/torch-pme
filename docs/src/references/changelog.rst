`Unreleased <https://github.com/lab-cosmo/torch-pme/>`_
-------------------------------------------------------

Added
#####

* Require consistent ``dtype`` between ``positions`` and ``neighbor_distances`` in
  ``Calculator`` classes and tuning functions.

`Version 0.2.0 <https://github.com/lab-cosmo/torch-pme/releases/tag/v0.2.0>`_ - 2025-01-23
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Added
#####

* Added a PyTorch implementation of the exponential integral function
* Added ``dtype`` and ``device`` for ``Calculator`` classes
* Added an example on the tuning scheme and usage, and how to optimize the ``cutoff``

Changed
#######

* Removed ``utils`` module. ``utils.tuning`` and ``utils.prefactor`` are now in the root
  of the package; ``utils.splines`` is now in the ``lib`` module
* Tuning now uses a grid-search based scheme, instead of a gradient based scheme
* Tuning functions no longer takes the ``cutoff`` parameter, and thus does not
  support a built-in NL calculation.
* Refactor the ``InversePowerLawPotential`` class to restrict the exponent to integer
  values

Fixed
#####

* Ensured consistency of ``dtype`` and ``device`` in the ``Potential`` and
  ``Calculator`` classses
* Fixed consistency of ``dtype`` and ``device`` in the ``SplinePotential`` class
* Fix inconsistent ``cutoff`` in neighbor list example
* All calculators now check if the cell is zero if the potential is range-separated

`Version 0.1.0 <https://github.com/lab-cosmo/torch-pme/releases/tag/v0.1.0>`_ - 2024-12-05
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Added
#####

* First release outside of the lab
