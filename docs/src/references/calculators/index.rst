Calculators
###########

Calculators evaluate range-separated models of non-bonded interactions. The most
fundamental classes that provide the interface to compute these types of interactions
are *calculators*, that take information on the periodic cell and the atom types and
positions and computes interatomic potential-like terms.

Our calculator API follows the `rascaline <https://luthaf.fr/rascaline>`_ API and coding
guidelines to promote usability and interoperability with existing workflows. All
calculators return the representations as a :obj:`List` of :class:`torch.Tensor`.

We also provide a :ref:`metatensor` interface, that use inputs and return outputs
compatible with the ``metatensor`` library.

.. note::

   All calculators compute the potential, from which the "atomic" energies :math:`E_i`
   can be determined by multiplying the potential :math:`V_i` with the charges
   :math:`q_i`. The total electrostatic energy :math:`E` is then the sum of all
   :math:`E_i`.

   .. math::

      E_i = q_i V_i
